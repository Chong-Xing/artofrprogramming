## Question 08 (Short Answer)

Take a look at the following codes and outcomes. Can you describe the potential problem occured in this execution? Can you offer a solution (an argument in R) to the problem?

> z <- matrix(c(1:8), ncol = 2)

> z
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    5
[2,]    2    6
[3,]    3    7
[4,]    4    8

> r <- z[3, ]

> r
[1] 3 7

Answer (pp. 80-81): Dimension reduction occured in the process. The matrix z was reduced to a vector r, and this could pose problems in some matrix operations later. The drop = FALSE argument can be a solution for the dimension reduction problem.

## Question 09 (R exercise; pp. 70-72)

Step 1: Create a 3 by 4 matrix m with any integers.

Step 2: Use the apply() function to calculate the means of the rows and the columns.

Step 3: Create a function f() that divides a four-element vextor by the vector (0.5, 6).

Step 4: Apply f() to the rows of m. Is the size of the returned matrix same as m? Why?

Answer:

## Step 1
m <- matrix(c(1:12), nrow = 3)
m

## Step 2
apply(m, 1, mean)
apply(m, 2, mean)

## Step 3
f <- function(x) x / c(0.5, 6)

## Step 4
apply(m, 1, f)

The returned matrix is 4 by 3. It is different from m which is a 3 by 4 matrix. It is because apply() stores returned values by colunms.
